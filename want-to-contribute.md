# Want to contribute?

If you want to fill in some of the blanks, post some of your characters backstory, or edit some of the story, feel free to edit the files in the link below. It's possible you need an account on github in order to contribute.   
  
[https://github.com/antoton/DnDHBZakhara](https://github.com/antoton/DnDHBZakhara)  
  
In order to open one of the pages, open the appropriate .md-file, and click 'edit this file' in the top right corner of the text screen.

The purpose of this is so everyone can consult all the 'known' information of the story, backgrounds, little tidbits. You don't have to publish every single fact of your character, only what you want others to know.
