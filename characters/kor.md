# Kor

Kor, short for Kornelius, /backname/ is a very peculiar half-orc. Torn between the extremely distinct origins of his cultured human father and his savage orc mother, Kor desperately tries to combine the two. Armed with his sword Respect, Kor looks for answers to a mystery in the sandy planes of Zakhara.

One day, an old colleague and great friend died at his doorsteps, with only a piece of paper on him. A message written in an unknown language, of which Kor quickly deduced it was written in a Midani script. In order to solve this murder case, Kor left his home and traveled southwards, in search for someone who could translate this mysterious message. However, as people were desperate to kill his friend, he knew not to divulge all information to just anyone.
