# Shaya and Sirona

Shaya and Sirona are half-elven siblings who grew up many miles away from Zakhara in a secluded community. They were each taught a different set of skills to accomplish their community's aim: to protect our world from interference from creatures that should not venture onto this plane. While hunting an unknown dark beast for a couple of months, they traced the beast into the sandy planes of Zakhara. 

Shaya is the younger of the two siblings. His young innocence is often a source of frustration for Sirona, and joy to the rest. He is not the one to take the lead, but whilst on the road he has been learning to become more self-sufficient and confident in his judgement and capabilities. 

Sirona, the older and more responsible one of the duo, hopes to protect her younger brother from the dangers of this world. This desire to secure her brother's wellbeing is sometimes in conflict with her urge to travel and learn; to pursue a life similar to the deity she whorships (Fharlanghn). In spite of that she accepts the weight of her responsibility to aid him in their common goal of maintaining the balance of our plane and destroy any otherworldly creatures that would threaten it.
