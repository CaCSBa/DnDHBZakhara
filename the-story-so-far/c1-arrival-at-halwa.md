# C1 Arrival at Halwa

Together with the trade's caravan, 4 peculiar people arrived in Halwa, each with a purpose. The Half-Elf siblings, Shaya and Sirona, arrived in Halwa after months of tracking a dark creature. After a quick ask-around, they were pointed towards the Temple of Kor, the god of Wisdom. The Half-Orc Kor arrived, in search of someone who would be able to translate an ancient Medinan text. After a rather strange and confounding confrontation with a local librarian, he was directed to the same Temple. Lastly, the dwarf Thorean arrived there, on his way to Hajama's Bastion. 

On the other side of Halwa, a beautiful High Elf arrived, by the name of Luna. She was searching for someone who could help her in finding alliances to end the dragon war going on in her tribe.
